# Sorting-with-TypeScript

## About the Project
I built this simple project that sorts the three different types of objects: arrays, strings, linked lists using the Bubble Sort Algorithm in abstract class Sorter.

- Added abstract class 'Sorter' giving it abstract methods: 'swap', 'compare', 'length'
- Added a method 'sort' to run it on an instance object of derived classes
- A 'sort' method of a base 'Sorter' class has an implementation body to sort collections by implemented Bubble Sort

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgments.
